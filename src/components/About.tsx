      Welcome! I'm Adam Janicki, a senior studying Computer Science at MIT! This
      is my personal website, and is somewhat a cross between a portfolio and
      informal website. Either way it's a mess.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm primarily interested in web development, specifically React. Speed and
      performance are also super fun, especially after taking 6.172 as a junior.
      This Summer I'm working as a frontend developer at Stripe.
      <br /> <br />
      Outside of work related things, I love to swim or do anything active. I
      also run a movie review website called{" "}
      <Link to="https://www.adamovies.com/" external>
        Adamovies
      </Link>
      . My favorite movie of all time is{" "}
      <Link to="https://www.adamovies.com/review/interstellar" external>
        Interstellar
      </Link>
      , but I have a soft spot for sci-fi in general.

      Welcome! I'm Adam Janicki, a Masters student studying Computer Science at
      MIT! You've somehow managed to stumble across my personal website,
      probably from a link on my resume, but if you managed to find this
      randomly, wow! <br />
      <br />
      I'm primarily interested in web development, but I also enjoy performance
      engineering, and making code run fast, which is why I'm a TA for MIT's
      famous{" "}
      <Link
        to="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/"
        external
      >
        6.172/6.106
      </Link>
      . This Summer, I worked as a full-stack developer at Stripe, where I'll be
      returning full-time next Summer.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of work related things, I'm an ex-swimmer, and I love to bike,
      play sports, or do anything active. I also run a movie review website
      called{" "}
      <Link to="https://adamovies.com" external>
        Adamovies
      </Link>
      . My favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, but I have a soft spot
      for sci-fi in general.

  "Summer 2024": (

      Hey there! My name is Adam Janicki; I'm a recent-grad turned Software
      Engineer. Currently, I'm enjoying working at{" "}
      <Link to="https://stripe.com" external>
        Stripe
      </Link>
      . Since I'm no longer focusing on showcasing myself to potential
      employers, this is really just a fun spot for me. Welcome! <br />
      <br />
      A little bit of background about me: web development has always been my
      favorite, but I also enjoy performance engineering, and
      cryptography/security. In the past, I was a student at MIT where I TA'd a
      few classes related to software development in TypeScript, as well as
      low-level performance engineering in C.
      <br />
      <br />
      My primary hobbies outside of work mainly include athletic activities; I'm
      a former college swimmer recovering from a shoulder surgery, so I've been
      enjoying getting into biking in running, potentially in preparation for a
      70.3 soon.
      <br />
      <br />
      My pride and joy is a movie review website I run and write for called{" "}
      <Link to="https://adamovies.com" external>
        Adamovies
      </Link>
      . Recently, I've been loving exploring older movies with my friends,
      mainly including Hitchcock, but also other old(ish) directors like
      Kubrick. Check it out if you'd like!

      Aloha! I'm Adam Janicki, a software engineering currently on all things
      email & SMS at <Link to="https://stripe.com">Stripe</Link>. Since this no
      longer serves <em>primarily</em> as means of showing my portfolio to
      potential employers, I try to keep this site fun for me, so keep an eye
      out for some hidden movie quotes!
      <br />
      <br />
      The TL;DR on me is web development has always been my favorite, but I also
      really enjoy optimizing code for performance since my days taking and
      TAing 6.172 at MIT a few years ago. But for now, I'm working on various
      fun sites and other frontend stuff.
      <br />
      <br />
      My primary hobbies outside of work mainly include athletic activities, but
      I've been hitting some roadblocks recently, with a shoulder reconstruction
      surgery almost two years ago, and most recently, a radial and humeral
      fracture from a bike crash.
      <br />
      <br />
      Of all the projects I've worked on, my pride and joy has always been{" "}
      <Link to="https://adamovies.com">Adamovies</Link>, my movie website that I
      run. I've been loving silver screen classics in the past years, and have
      ventured into writing some articles about{" "}
