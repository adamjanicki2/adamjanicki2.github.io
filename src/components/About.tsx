      Welcome! I'm Adam Janicki, a senior studying Computer Science at MIT! This
      is my personal website, and is somewhat a cross between a portfolio and
      informal website. Either way it's a mess.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm primarily interested in web development, specifically React. Speed and
      performance are also super fun, especially after taking 6.172 as a junior.
      This Summer I'm working as a frontend developer at Stripe.
      <br /> <br />
      Outside of work related things, I love to swim or do anything active. I
      also run a movie review website called{" "}
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.adamovies.com/">Adamovies</ExternalLink>.
      My favorite movie of all time is{" "}
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.adamovies.com/review/Interstellar">
        Interstellar
      </ExternalLink>
      , but I have a soft spot for sci-fi in general.

      Welcome! I'm Adam Janicki, a Masters student studying Computer Science at
      MIT! You've somehow managed to stumble across my personal website,
      probably from a link on my resume, but if you managed to find this
      randomly, wow! <br />
      <br />
      I'm primarily interested in web development, but I also enjoy performance
      engineering, and making code run fast, which is why I'm a TA for MIT's
      famous{" "}
      <ExternalLink href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/">
        6.172/6.106
      </ExternalLink>
      . This Summer, I worked as a full-stack developer at Stripe, where I'll be
      returning full-time next Summer.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of work related things, I'm an ex-swimmer, and I love to bike,
      play sports, or do anything active. I also run a movie review website
      called <ExternalLink href="https://adamovies.com">Adamovies</ExternalLink>
      . My favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, but I have a soft spot
      for sci-fi in general.

      Hey there! My name is Adam Janicki; I'm a recent-grad turned Software
      Engineer. Currently, I'm enjoying working at{" "}
      <ExternalLink href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</ExternalLink>. Since I'm
      no longer focusing on showcasing myself to potential employers, this is
      really just a fun spot for me. Welcome! <br />
      <br />
      A little bit of background about me: web development has always been my
      favorite, but I also enjoy performance engineering, and
      cryptography/security. In the past, I was a student at MIT where I TA'd a
      few classes related to software development in TypeScript, as well as
      low-level performance engineering in C.
      <br />
      <br />
      My primary hobbies outside of work mainly include athletic activities; I'm
      a former college swimmer recovering from a shoulder surgery, so I've been
      enjoying getting into biking in running, potentially in preparation for a
      70.3 soon.
      <br />
      <br />
      My pride and joy is a movie review website I run and write for called{" "}
      <ExternalLink href="https://adamovies.com">Adamovies</ExternalLink>.
      Recently, I've been loving exploring older movies with my friends, mainly
      including Hitchcock, but also other old(ish) directors like Kubrick. Check
      it out if you'd like!
